# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-DL
Our project utilizes deep neural networks to enhance breast cancer detection. By analyzing complex medical data, we aim to develop a robust system for timely diagnosis, improving patient outcomes.
Developed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using Python and TensorFlow/Keras for breast cancer classification. Leveraged the power of libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for seamless data handling, analysis, and visualization. Employed scikit-learn for robust data preprocessing, model evaluation, and metrics calculation, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the constructed DNN on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. Utilized TensorFlow and Keras libraries to construct and train the DNN, leveraging their advanced functionalities for deep learning model development and achieving [mention your achieved accuracy] accuracy on test data. Engineered a multi-layered neural network architecture with dense (fully connected) layers, optimizing both model performance and interpretability, thereby enhancing the comprehensibility and reliability of the model's predictions.
